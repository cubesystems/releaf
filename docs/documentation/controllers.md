# Customizing controllers

By default, Releaf controllers automatically have Index, Create, Edit and Destroy actions working out of the box.

All aspects of the default functionality can be fully customized, extended or disabled.

These chapters describe the general principles of working with the default actions:

* [Index action](index/)
* [New and Edit actions](edit/)
* [Destroy action](destroy/)
* [Disabling default actions](features/)
* [Adding custom actions](custom-actions/)

Some more customizations:

* [Changing the resource class](resource-class/)

The last chapter about controllers covers some [Common usage patterns](resource-class/).

Further interface customizations for each action are described in the [Customizing views](../../builders/) chapter.
