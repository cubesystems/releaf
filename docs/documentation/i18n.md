## I18n

### Pluralization

By default releaf will only create non-pluralized translation version.
`I18n.t("cow", count: 1)` will create empty translation with `cow` key.

If you need to auto create all pluralized versions for translation, pass "create_plurals: true" option.
`I18n.t("cow", count: 1, create_plurals: true)` will create `cow.one, cow.many, cow.zero` and other variations depeding on Releaf.available_locales.

### Caveat
Calling `I18n.t("cow", count: 1)` and then changing translation call to `I18n.t("cow", count: 1, create_plurals: true)` will not result of pluralized translations creation as first call will create empty translation and mark given key ("cow") as missing. To solve this problem force releaf i18n cache to reload (restart rails, save some translations from admin or call `I18n.backend.reload_cache`)
